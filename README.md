# React Labs at ITI

Welcome to the React Labs repository for your ITI course! This repository contains the solutions and resources for the React labs conducted during your course.

## Introduction

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, developed and maintained by Facebook. It is widely used for creating interactive and dynamic web applications with reusable components.

These labs are designed to help you understand the fundamentals of React, including components, props, state, lifecycle methods, hooks, routing, and more.

## Installation

To start working with React on your Windows machine, you need to set up a development environment. Here's how to get started:

1. **Install Node.js and npm**: React projects typically require Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) for managing dependencies and running build scripts. You can download Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and follow the installation instructions. npm is included with Node.js.

2. **Create a New React Project**: Once Node.js is installed, you can create a new React project using the Create React App tool. Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you want to create your project, and run the following command:

      ```bash
   npx create-react-app my-app
   ```
  
Replace `my-app` with the name you want to give to your project.

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Change your current directory to the newly created project directory:

      ```bash
   cd my-app
   ```

4. **Run the Development Server**: Start the development server by running the following command:

      ```bash
   npx create-react-app my-app
   ```

This will start the development server and open your React application in your default web browser.

## Usage

Each lab session is organized into separate directories within this repository. Inside each directory, you'll find the React project files, along with any additional resources or instructions provided during the lab session.

To use the code in this repository, simply clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

git clone https://github.com/KarimMohamedDesouki/React-Labs.git


Then, navigate to the specific lab directory you're interested in and explore the React project files and resources.
